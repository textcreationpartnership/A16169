            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Auguſt. de tri. lib. 6.</note> the whiche ſaieth <hi>Auguſtine</hi> may eaſily be ſpoken and beléeued, but not ſéene but by a pure hart. For when we doe ſay that God is, that God is good, that he is greate, he is wiſe, he is mercifull, he is almightie, and whatſoeuer elſe is ſpoken of that ſingle manifoldeneſſe, or manifolde ſingleneſſe of God: the woordes are not to be taken in ſuche ſenſe,<note place="margin">No qualitie in God.</note> as when they are ſpoken of any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, yea and the ſingleſt creature: the ſoule.

But ſo muſt we not vnderſtand theſe wordes and thinges in God: for in him his being is the ſelfe ſame thing that his goodneſſe, or his greatnes is, or whatſoeuer elſe is truely ſpoken of him. And againe his greatneſſe, and his goodneſſe are the very ſame thing that his eſſence is, and in him no qualitie: for there is nothing in him, whiche is not himſelfe, and his very eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and ſubſtaunce: neither was any one thing that is in him, there before an other: but all there at once e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſtingly: neither can any one be away, or be ſunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red one from another, without the corruption of his eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.<note place="margin">We do ſpeake vnproperly of God by adiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues.

                  <hi>Auguſtine</hi> doth truely thinke that he can not be put aptly into any of the predicamentes of the Logicians. For he cannot be a ſubſtaunce, becauſe he doth not ſubſiſt vnto any thing: neither is there any thing abiding in him as in a ſubiect. For as I ſaid before there is nothing in him, that is not himſelf: ſo alſo we muſt beléeue, that God is great with out quantitie, good without qualitie, preſident without ſite, conteining all things without habite, euery where
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:2427:7"/> wholy without being incloſed in any place, eternal with out time, making and doing all things without labour, or chaunging of himſelfe or his ſtate, and ſuffering no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all.

For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he being a ſpirite can not do them himſelfe, yet are they within his power: for hee can doe them in his creatures, and doth make man to goe and ſpeake: and alſo worketh al thoſe actions in al liuing things, which do them by his power.<note place="margin">Auguſt lib 15. de Trinitate.</note> Neither becauſe he cannot ſinne nor doe ill, is hee the leſſe Almightie, becauſe they be no pointes and partes of power, but of infirmitie &amp; weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. For if he could doe them, he were not omnipotent: therfore that he cannot do ill,<note place="margin">Auguſt. lib. 1. de ſymbolo.</note> it is not to be imputed vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to impotencie, but vnto power. The like alſo may bee ſaid of that he cannot die, he cannot be wretched, he can<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>not be deceiued, he cannot be ouercome: for if he were ſubiect vnto theſe defects: he were not Almightie. And alſo hereby is hee proued to be Almightie: becauſe that althoughe thoſe imperfections and wantes cannot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proche vnto him, yet can he work them in other. For he can make man to die, be wretched, be deceiued &amp; ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. Wherefore herein doth appeare the omnipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of God, that he doth all things that he will haue don, neither doth he ſuffer any thing at all. For nothing is there which is able to inferre any corruption vnto him, or to make him ſuffer ought, neither is any thing able to bring any impediment or lett vnto his doings: but all thinges can he doe without any impeachment, vnleſſe it bee thoſe thinges, by doing of which either his digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ſhould be diminiſhed, or ſome thing derogated from his excellencie. Wherefore is hee truely omnipotent, who is able to doe all thinges, the doing of whome is

               <p>There flattered him thoſe that were in greateſt eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, among whom was alſo <hi>L.

               <p>On a time <hi>Caligula</hi> affirmed that he had carnally delt with the Moone,<note place="margin">Vitellius his wittie anſwer.</note> and would knowe of <hi>Vitellius</hi> whither that he did not ſée him dooing it with the Goddeſſe: then <hi>Vitellius</hi> as one aſtonied, caſting downe his head ſoftely and trembling ſaid: my ſouereigne it is graunted onely vnto you Goddes, to ſée one another. But to returne vnto <hi>Caius,</hi> he being carried further into follie, built vp a Temple vnto him ſelfe, and proper vnto his owne Godhead, wherin was ſet vp his ſtatuie of golde, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che was euery day decked with ſuche garments, as he ware him ſelfe.

               <p>Euery day were ſupplications and vowes made vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him and ſacrifices of all kindes of delicate byrdes, of greate price, as <hi>Phinocopteri,</hi> pecockes, buſtardes, Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kie cockes, and other ſtraunge birdes.

When he had ſpoken thoſe words, he being more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſly vexed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the violence of the peine, was inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently borne into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> palace. But ſhortly after, when it was bruted abroad, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was vpon the point of death, a great multitude of al ages &amp; ſects came vnto the palace, who lying on the ground grouely clothed in hairecloth, after their countrie guiſe, made inceſſant ſupplications vnto God for the kings recouerie, all the kinges palace ringing with their dolful cries and lamentations: whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as in the mean time, the king lying in a chamber aboue,
<pb facs="tcp:2427:21"/> and looking downe, and beholding them lying flatte on their faces with lamentable wéeping, could not abſtein from teares him ſelfe: but being fiue dayes thus tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, inceſſantly with griping peines of his bellie, at the lengthe brake in ſunder the tedious thread of loth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome life. Thus by this long narration of thoſe, whoſe proſperitie made them to forget their maker,<note place="margin">A golden ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Augu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtine.</note> yea, and them ſelues too, that ſaying of <hi>Auguſtines</hi> is verified: that as all fruites, all graines, all woodes haue their worme, and euery one a diuers worme the one from the other: ſo the worme of riches, power, and proſperitie, is pryde, which doth corrupt and quite conſume them, as all other wormes do the ſubſtaunces wherein they are bred: neuer dying, vntill that they haue chaunged the names: turning woods to rottenneſſe, yron to luſt and droſſe, power to pouertie: the vnſearchable wiſedome of God ſo ordeyning, that thoſe thinges whiche it might ſéeme, no forreighe forre could be able to hurt, ſhoulde them ſelues ingender in them ſelues, a thing to deſtroy them ſelues, and be vtterly conſumed by an inward yl.

Then the king ſpeaking neuer a worde, erected his mynde to contemplate the power of God: and that he might with a manifeſt argument and demonſtration, reproue the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:2427:21"/> vaine and falſe flatterie of his ſouldiour: he did put off his cloke, and wrapping it round together like a bowle, and ſetting downe vpon it hard by the water, that then flowed, ſpake thus: Waue I commaund thée, that thou touch not my féete. He had not ſo ſoone ſpoken theſe wordes (thoſe whiche attended on him woondering to what ende hee did theſe thinges) when beholde the waue in ſurging all to wette him.</p>
               <p>Then he going backe ſaide: Syrs call ye me a king who am not able to cohibite and ſtaye this litle waue? certes no mortall man is woorthie of ſo highe a name: there is one onely king the Father of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte, with whome he doth reigne: at whoſe becke al thinges are gouerned and ruled, him let vs worſhippe: him let vs call king: him of kinges, him of all peoples and nations to be the Lord, him of heauen, of the earthe, of the ſea to be the ruler, let vs not onely confeſſe, but alſo profeſſe, and beſides him none.

O the madneſſe of them that of their beginninges do thinke them ſelues borne to pride, and to be Goddes. The firſt hope of ſtrength, &amp; function, and gyft of time, makes him to craule on all foure. How long is it er he doth goe? howe long before he ſpeaketh? howe long before his mouthe he firme for meate? howe long doth his moulde pante: a ſigne and token of a ſingular weakeneſſe among the thinges that liue? all other liuing thinges do féele and knowe their owne nature, ſome vſe ſwiftneſſe of foote, ſome wight winge, other their ſtrength, other ſwimme, onely man knoweth nothing without teaching.

Nowe if we runne through all partes of his life, we ſhall finde and ſee no time voide of paine, looſe of gréefes, and frée from tormentes of diſeaſes. In the ages of men, ſaies
<pb facs="tcp:2427:23"/> diuine <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> happen ſuche diſeaſes: in infants and children newly borne, hotte vlceres of the mouthe, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitinges, coughes, watchinges, ſwellinges, inflamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the nauill, moiſtneſſe of the eares: but when they come to bréede téeth, itching of the gummes, agues, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uulſions, laſkes and woorſe, when they put foorthe the dogge téeth when they are waxen elder, inflamations of the partes betwéene the mouthe and the gullet, falling inward of the ſpondill in the nape of the necke, Aſthma or haſing, the ſtones, wormes both round, and aſtarides, a kinde of wortes called acrochordones, ſatyariſmes or ſtanding of the yarde by a ſmal inflamation, ſtrumes or the Kinges euill, and other ſmall tumors: when they be elder and come vnto fourtéene yeares, there happen many of the diſeaſes of the ages which went before, and longer agues and bléeding at the noſe. But vnto young men ſpitting of bloud, conſumpſions of the lungs, ſharp feuers, the falling ſickneſſe, and other diſeaſes, ſpecially thoſe, whiche I haue ſpoken of before, but vnto them whiche haue paſſed this age, befall Aſthma, or haſinges, pleuriſies, inflamations of the lungs, lethargies, phren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, burning agues, long laſkes, ſkourings vpward and downeward, bloudy fluxes, lienteries, piles. But vnto old men hard fetching of breath, rheumes with coughes, ſtranguries, difficulties of making water, paines of the ioyntes, ſwimming of the head, apoplexies, cacheries, it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ouer all the body, moiſtneſſe of the bellie, eyes and eares, dimneſſe of ſight, glaucedines or drineſſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of the chriſtaline humour in the eyes, and ill hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. But although no age of mannes life is frée from diſeaſes, yet perhappes ſome parte of the yeare is ſo benigne that in it the body hauing reſt from gréefe may refreſhe and repaire his ſtrength whiche was welnéere quite tyred and killed with the maladies and paynes whiche it ſuffered before. No (ſaies <hi>Hippocrates</hi>) all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:2427:23"/> happen at all times, but yet ſome diſeaſes are more bredde and worſe at one time, then at another. In the ſpringtime reigne madneſſe, melancholy, the falling ſickneſſe, fluxes of bloud, ſquinſeis, catarrhes, hoarſnes, coughes, leproſies, morphewes, impetigines, many vl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerous puſtules, ſmall tumours, paines of the ioyntes. In the Summer ſome of thoſe before rehearſed and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, continuall, and burning, and very many tertian and quartan agues, vomitings, and laſks, ophthalmies, or inflamations of the eares, paines of the eares, exulce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the mouth, putrefactions of the general parts and ſweatinges.

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:2427:43"/> béene built by 360000. men in twentie yeares, of <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian</hi> ſtone. It is ingrauen in the <hi>Pyramis,</hi> that there was laide out for the prouiſion of the workmen in perſely, onions, and garlike 1600. talents, whiche is 288000.l But <hi>Plinie</hi> hathe 1800. which amounteth to 324000.l. whiche if it be ſo, ſaies <hi>Herodotus,</hi> how muche is it credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble was conſumed vpon the tooles, meate, and apparell of the workemen. Euery fronte of this <hi>Pyramis</hi> (for it was foureſquare) being eight acres broade, and ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny highe: whiche acres of theirs being 240. long, and 120. broade, conteine 28800. foote, and multiplied by eight amounteth to 230400. foote, and al of ſquare ſtone, and very decently and finely ſhutte together: neuer a ſtone being leſſe and ſhorter then thirtie foote. But whereas the <hi>Pyramides</hi> be wonderful, yet do the <hi>Labe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthes</hi> farre excéede them in ſumptuous folie.<note place="margin">The Labe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthes.</note> The E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian Laberinthe hathe twelue haules couered ouer with one roufe, and ſixe gates on the northe ſide, &amp; ſixe other on the ſouthe, directly one ouer againſt the other: and encloſed with a wall. The houſes or roomes of it, are part vnder the ground, and parte aboue, built one vpon the other, and bothe in number 3500. The vpper buildinges, ſaies <hi>Herodotus,</hi> we ſawe, and reporte that which we behelde. But we learned the lower by heare ſay, &amp; relation of others. For the gouernours of the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tians</hi> would by no meanes haue them ſhewed, becauſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ſay, there were bothe the ſepulchres of the kings, that built the <hi>Labyrinth,</hi> &amp; alſo of the ſacred crocodiles: ſo that of the lower edifices we relate that, whiche wée know by heare ſay: the vpper we ourſelues ſawe, grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then mens workes. For the goings out through the houſes, and the goings backe through the haules, moſte diuerſe, did ſtrike me with infinite admiration. From the haule, we goe into parlours, out of parlours into chambers, out of chambers into other ſolars, and out of
<pb facs="tcp:2427:44"/> parlours againe into other halles. Of all theſe edifices the roofe ouer head is of ſtone, as be alſo the walles, and garniſhed euery where with ingrauen imagerie. All the halles for the greateſt parte, are of fine wrought white ſtone, ſet rounde about with pillers: cloſe to the angle where the labyrinthe endeth, ſtandeth a pyramis of fourtie paces, euery pace being ſixe foote, euery foote foure hand breadth, in this pyramis be there great bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes, ingrauen: where the way is vnder the grounde. And whereas the labyrinthe is ſuche,<note place="margin">The lake of Merios.</note> yet the ſtanding poole of <hi>Merios</hi> where the labyrinthe ſtandeth, maketh me much more to maruell, whoſe circuite is 3600. fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs, that is to wit, as much as <hi>Aegypt</hi> is vnto the ſea. Where it is déepeſt is it 50. paces. That it was made by hand and digged downe ſo déepe to the two pyrami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des conuince which ſtande almoſt in the middeſt of the lake, being fiftie paces aboue the water, and ſo muche vnder. Vpon both of whom is there a colloſſus of ſtone ſetting in a throne, ſo that the pyramides are 100 paces highe. The water of the poole is not naturall, for the ſoyle is verie drye, but deriued out of <hi>Nylus,</hi> ſixe mone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes, flowing into the poole, and running backe into <hi>Nylus</hi> ſo many. In thoſe monethes that it runnes out, inriching the kings treaſure euerie day with a talent of ſiluer, for the aboundance of fiſh which is in it, and whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it floweth into the poole, euery day with twentie pou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds. This poole do the inhabitants ſay, runnes out into the Syrtes of <hi>Africa,</hi> through a mightie ditch digged vnder the ground through the middeſt of the lande. Of theſe monſtrous mazes thus writeth <hi>Plinie.</hi> The firſt of them that euer was made was built in <hi>Aegypt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthes out of Plinie.</note> about 3600. yeares ago, of the which <hi>Dedalus</hi> no doubt, tooke a plat to build his labyrinthe in <hi>Creta:</hi> but he imitated not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the hundreth part of it: which doth conteine goings round of wayes, and occourſes and recourſes, méetings
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:2427:44"/> with wayes, and goings backe of wayes, out of whom no man can get him ſelfe: and this happeneth not by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the wayes doe often turne, and winde this way, and that way: but only by reaſon of the thicke ſtanding of doores, ſet of purpoſe to deceiue men, when they méete with the right way, and to make them go backe againe into the wrong wayes. This was the ſeconde laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthe: the thirde was in <hi>Lemnos,</hi> the fourth in <hi>Italie,</hi> all of them vaulted aboue with poliſhed ſtone. The <hi>Aegyptian</hi> labyrinthe had at the comming in pillers of marble of <hi>Paros,</hi> but al the reſt of the pillers of the houſe were of marble of <hi>Syene:</hi> whiche I maruell at, ſéeing that <hi>Syenian</hi> marble is far fairer, gliſtering with thicke red ſpottes like fire: the ſtones are ſo ſtrongly compac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that no not many ages can diſſolue them, the <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropolitanes</hi> helping to their vttermoſt, who did wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully annoy that enuied worke. To declare the poſition of the worke and all partes of it I mynd not, ſeeing that it is diuided into regions and into ſixtéene ſhires, which they call <hi>Nomos,</hi> vnto the names of them, ſo many huge houſes being attributed. Furthermore, it doth conteine the temples of all the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Goddes, and moreouer, fiftéene <hi>Nemeſes</hi> included in chappels. There be a great number of pyramides of fourtie yardes high, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one hauing at the foote ſixe walles. Nowe when they be wearie of going, come they vnto that inexplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble errour of the wayes: but alſo before that they goe vp into the high dining chambers, and galleries, all of them being of ninetie ſtayres: within are there pillers of <hi>Porphyrite</hi> ſtone, images of the gods, ſtatues of kings, and idoles of monſters. But ſuch was the ſtanding of ſome of the houſes, that when they opened the doores, there was a terrible thunder hearde within: but for the greateſt part the entries &amp; wayes be darke, &amp; againe, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the walles of the labyrinth, be other huge pyles of
<pb facs="tcp:2427:45"/> buildings adioyned, which they call Pteron. And there alſo are other houſes vnder the ground. Ynough is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> and <hi>Cretan</hi> labyrinth. The laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth of <hi>Lemnos</hi> is like vnto them, onely more maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for a hundreth and fortie pillers. Alſo <hi>Porſena</hi> king of <hi>Hetruria</hi> made one for to be his tumbe: and alſo that the vanitie of forreigne kings might be paſſed by the Italians. But ſéeing the fabuloſitie doth excéede al credite, we wil vſe in the declaration of it, <hi>Varro</hi> his own wordes: he was buried hard by the citie of <hi>Cluſium,</hi> in the whiche place he lefte a monument of ſquare ſtone, euery one of the ſides being thirtie foote broade, and fiftie highe: and within the baſe of the worke, is there within a labyrinthe, inextricable, into which if one goe without a clewe of thread, he cannot finde the way out. Vpon that ſquare worke ſtand fiue pyramides, foure in the corners, and one in the middeſt, being at the baſe thrée ſcore and fiftéene foote broade, and a hundreth and fiftie highe, made ſpire like, and on the toppe of all is a ball of braſſe, and a Pegaſus vpon it, from whom ſmall belles hang downe by chaines, who being driuen by the winde made a noyſe, which may be heard a great waye off, as in the olde time it was at <hi>Dodona.</hi> Vppon the which ball be foure other Pyramides, euery one a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth foote highe, aboue whome vpon one grounde, or floore are fiue other Pyramides ſet, whoſe height <hi>Varro</hi> was aſhamed to put in: the tales of the <hi>Hetruſces</hi> ſaye, they were as high as all the reſt of the works: ſuch was the extreme fooliſh madnes of the king, to ſéeke for glory by coſt which would do no man good: and moreouer, to weary the wealth of the kingdome, but yet ſo, that the praiſe of the workeman ſhoulde be the greater. From Egypt alſo,<note place="margin">Of Obeliſces.</note> the mother of all naughtineſſe, came obeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſces, ſo called: bycauſe that they reſemble the forme of a ſpit, being long ſtones of marble of <hi>Syene,</hi> ſet vp in the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:2427:45"/> the honour of the ſunne, whoſe beames they do very wel expreſſe. The firſt ſayes <hi>Plinie,</hi> that ordeined them in Egypt was <hi>Mitres,</hi> being admoniſhed by a dreame, <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodotus</hi> affirmes it to be <hi>Pheron,</hi> and that it was 400. cubites long, and eight broade. <hi>Plinie</hi> telleth of many in Egypt, and among al other of one the worke of twenty thouſand men: whiche when the king <hi>Ramiſes</hi> woulde haue to be raiſed, and feared that the engines were not able to beare the weight of him, to denounce greater daunger vnto the care and charge of the workemen, he tied his owne ſonne to the toppe of the ſtone, that the ſauing of his life might procure the ſtone good of the workmen. For a miracle, ſaies <hi>Plinie, Auguſtus</hi> brought one by ſea from Egypt of a hundreth and twentie fiue féete and nine inches beſides the baſe. And <hi>Caligula</hi> one more marueilous then all the thinges that euer were ſéene vpon the ſea. No leſſe difficultie had <hi>Semyramis</hi> to bring one cut out of the <hi>Armenian</hi> mounteines 150. foote long, and 24. broade, and thicke: carried from <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia</hi> in a great number of ioyned cartes, vnto <hi>Euphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> and from thence by ſhip vnto <hi>Babylon,</hi> where it was ſet vp, being reckoned among one of the wonders of the world. It is alſo commonly helde that ſhe made an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the miracles, that is, the garden at <hi>Babylon</hi>

Euery ſide of this garden conteined foure acres: the comming vnto it was as it were vnto a mounteine: edifices be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one built vpon other, that they might ſée ſtanding in it all the countrie rounde about. There were vaults ſet on the ground to beare the weight of the whole gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
<pb facs="tcp:2427:46"/> then other were built vpon other, alwayes greater and greater. For the vppermoſte vpon whom ſtoode the walles of the gardens were fiftie cubits high. And thus did they make the ground &amp; flowre of the garden. There were laid ioyces of ſtone 16. foote long, &amp; 6. broade.

Alſo places were made to receiue the water, and to voide it. Vppon this pauiment was ſo muche earthe laide, as would ſuffice for the rootes of mightie trées, and this made the garden: in the whiche highe trées of all ſortes growing made a very pleaſaunt ſight. Some of them roſe vppe fiue hundreth foote aboue the ground, and bare fruite as well as if they had come out of the botome of the earth.

Moreouer, the bridge being built at the narroweſt place of the riuer, did cauſe it to be the more hardly and painefully done: by reaſon that the riuer running from a broade channell into a narrowe, did runne the more viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, and was alſo the déeper there.</p>
               <p>But we will not ſuffer <hi>Traiane</hi> to inioy this glorie of fame, for we wil ſhew you y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this magnificent madneſſe of an Emperour, was paſſed by the workes of <hi>Marcus Scaurus,</hi> a priuate man: whoſe Edilitie (ſayes <hi>Plinie</hi>) I knowe not, whether of all other things it moſt deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the manners of the citie, or whether <hi>Sylla</hi> did more miſchief by proſcribing of ſo many thouſand citizens, or by aduau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cing his ſonne in law to ſo great riches.

And on a time willing his next fellowe to play for him, he went out into the court of the palace, &amp; eſpying two riche Gentlemen of the order of the horſemen, he commaunded them without any tariaunce immediatly to be apprehended, and all their goodes ſeazed: &amp; when he had done this, he came in againe ſkipping and reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing: and ſaide that he neuer had a better hande at dyce in all his life. But when his daughter was borne, he complaining of pouertie, and now not only of the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of an Emperour, but alſo of a Father, receiued con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions for the findeing and marriage money of his daughter. He alſo made proclamation that he would receiue newe yeares gyftes on newe yeares day: vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which day he ſtoode in the porche of his houſe, for to receiue the almeſſes or gyftes whiche all ſorts of people
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:2427:53"/> with full hands and boſomes threw downe before him. Finally, this vnthrift who knew no other vſe of money then to daſh it away riotouſly, and thought it high trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in any man to be riche, was inflamed with ſuche a lewde luſt to touche money: that very oftentimes hée would cauſe immeaſurable heaps of monie to be ſtrew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed abroade, in a large roome, and he would walke vpon it with his bare féete,<note place="margin">Nero his ſhameleſſe ſhiftes for money.</note> and euer nowe &amp; then tumble vp and downe vpon them. But when his kinde coſen <hi>Nero,</hi> who vſed to call them ſtinking churles, and miſers that did ſpend according vnto their reuenues, and praiſed them for good felowes, Gentlmen like men, and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent in déede, that would abuſe their goodes, and ſpende it away they care not howe: when I ſay he by kéeping no meane, either in giuing or ſpending, allowing <hi>Tiry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates</hi> the King of <hi>Armenia</hi> during his abode at <hi>Rome,</hi> ſixe thouſand poundes a day, and giuing him at his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture away, aboue millies ſeſtertium 781250. pound, by inriching raſcal knaues with ſenatours wealth, and burying them with kinglike funeralles, by playing at dice 3000. pound a ſpeck, by fiſhing with nettes of golde, twyne, and ropes of purple and ſcarlet, by neuer wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring one garment twiſe, by neuer traueling with fewer then a 1000 wagons, a great number of whome were of ſiluer, and finally by his madde buildings, and works had brought himſelfe bare, and quite without money, that he was not able no not to pay the ſouldiers their wages, nor the Veteranes their rewards and penſions: he bent his minde to falſe accuſations &amp; robberies. Firſt of al he decréed that he ſhould for halfe haue thrée partes of all the goods of ſuche libertes, as w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out probable cauſe were called by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of any family or ſtocke that was of kin or aliance vnto him &amp; the <hi>Caeſars.</hi> Furthermore, that the Teſtaments of all men vnthankfull vnto the Emperour, ſhould apperteine vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Eſchequer of the

And neyther that thoſe whiche had written them, or tolde other what they ſhould write, ſhoulde eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape ſcotfrée: and alſo that all actes &amp; wordes, to whom there was any promooter, ſhould be within the compaſſe of the ſtatute of highe treaſon, the penaltie wherof is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gréeable to ours. And when that he had forbidden the vſe of purple colour, and hadde ſuborned a verlotte vppon a markette day to ſell of it, two or thrée oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, he impriſoned all the merchauntes of the citie, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing them to fine at his pleaſure. Moreouer as he was buſie in ſinging, he eſpying out of the ſpectacles, a matrone appairelled in purple, which was forbidden: he ſhewed her vnto his atturneis and agentes, and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned her not only out of her gowne: but alſo out of all the goods ſhe had. He reuoked alſo al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rewards of crownes which the cities had giuen him before at any time at playes and games. He neuer gaue office vnto any man, but he ſaid vnto him, thou knoweſt what I lacke, and let vs this do, that no man may haue any thing. Hée robbed a great number of Temples of their giftes, he melted their Images of golde, and ſiluer, and among them alſo the Images of the houſholde Gods of <hi>Rome,</hi> whom <hi>Galba</hi> afterward made againe. Finally when he had wilfully ſet on fire the citie, which burnt ſeuen dais, and ſeuen nightes continually conſuming beſide an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaſurable number of faire palaces, the houſes of the auncient captaines, which yet at that time were ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the ſpoiles of their enimies, the Temples of the Goddes built by the kings, ye and thoſe which were afterward vowed and dedicated in the warres with the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> and <hi>Galles,</hi> and to be ſhorte all that had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained of the antiquitie, worthe either the ſéeing or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie: and the people, for feare of being burnt had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken their houſes, he woulde ſuffer no man to come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine vnto his goodes whiche was ſaued, and with ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidies
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:2427:54"/> and collections almoſte quite beggered bothe the Prouinces, and alſo all priuate men: ye and murdered moſt of the citie, which were of any notorious wealthe. But leauing <hi>Nero,</hi> theſe are <hi>Suetonius</hi> his woordes, of <hi>Domitian:</hi> that he beeing brought quite out of money through the charges of his workes and games, and the augmenting of his ſouldiours wages, attempted to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate the charges of the warres, diminiſhing the number of the ſouldiers.

               <p>Nowe there were of all the Centuries, accounting the eightéene Centuries of the equites or horſmen, (all the other were of footemen) one hundreth ninetie and thrée: who in giuing their voyces, had euery one their dignitie reſerued: ſo that they which were moſt valued in the Cenſors booke, and bare the greateſt burthens of the warres (for <hi>Seruius Tullius</hi> ordeyned, that they ſhould not pay their tributes by the pooll as they did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but euery man according vnto his wealth) ſhoulde firſt giue their voyces. But the firſt claſſis or compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie (for they were diuided into foure) had in it eightie Centuries, with whome alſo the horſmen gaue their voyces: who all being in number ninetie and eight, did excéede the number of halfe the voyces. Whereby it came to paſſe, that what ſo euer they were agréed vpon, was accounted for decréed. But if that the firſt claſſis or companie, and the horſmen could not agrée (whiche ſildome times happened) then were the Centuries of the ſecond order called, and ſo foorth other in order, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they neuer lightly came vnto the laſt claſſis or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie. <hi>Tullius</hi> his prudence vſing this equitie, that they which were moſt charged, ſhould be requited in the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages and voyces: from whome althoughe that no man ſéemed to be excluded: yet all the power and ſway was in the horſmen, &amp; the Centuries of the firſt claſſis.

After they had done this: then they caried the dead bodie forth to be ſeaſoned and dreſſed. There were certain appointed for this purpoſe: who when the body was brought vnto them, did ſhewe them which brought it thrée images of woode: painted euery one like vnto a dead man. And they ſay that one of them was very curiouſly and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly made, whoſe name, ſaies <hi>Herodotus,</hi> if I ſhoulde name I ſhall not do holily. The ſecond was inferiour and of leſſe price. The third very good cheape. Then they demaunded, to which of theſe patterns they would haue the Image of their dead perſon made. Then after they were agréed of the price, they departed. But the ſeaſoners trimmed the body very diligently after this manner.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all they drewe out all the braine out of his head throughe his noſe with a hooked inſtrument, filling vp the place again with medicinal matter. Then they ripped his bellie w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> an <hi>Aethiopian</hi> ſtone, &amp; tooke out all the paunch, which when they haue made very cleane and filled with wine of <hi>Phoenicia,</hi> they ſtuffed full of bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten odors: &amp; then farſing al the belly with pure myrrhe, cinamon and other odours, except franckincenſe, they ſowed it vppe againe. When they had thus done, they kéeping it in a ſecret place within, did ſalt it 70. dayes for longer it is not lawfull to ſalt them. When that the 70. dayes were expired, they waſhed, and wrapped it in a ſhéete of biſſine, mallng it with whip cordes, which they annointed with a gumme, that the Egyptians doe for the moſt parte vſe in ſtéede of glewe. Then the kinſefolkes of the dead man receiuing the bodye, did make an Image of a man of woode, in the whiche they doe put the dead man, and ſo laye him vppe.</p>

But vnder it was there another leſſe Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle ſet, but in forme and garniſhing very like vnto the firſt, with gates &amp; doores ſtanding wide open.

Then the bed being carried vp into the ſeconde Tabernacle, they get together ſpices, perfumes of all kindes, fruites, hearbes, and all ſwéete ſmelling iuyces, and powred them downe by heapes. For there was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nation, nor citie, nor man, excelling in any honour or dignitie, but euery one of them did anie one vpon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, giue thoſe their laſt gyfts vnto the honour of the Prince.

After all theſe ſolemnities were celebrated, the ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor of the Empire tooke a fire brand, and thruſted it into the Tabernacle. Then all the multitude on all partes did thicke and thréefolde put to fire and incontinently al the whole edifice being filled full of that drie ſtuffe, and thoſe odoriferous thinges, burned with a mightie fire. Anon, from the loweſt &amp; leſt Tabernacle was an Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle let go, who fléeing out at the topp of a building, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the fire, it was beléeued did carrie the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours ſoule into heauen.

In the loweſt parte thereof lay the dead body, incloſed in a cheſt, but his image of waxe in triumphall robes was laide aboue to be ſéene of all men. This did the nominated Conſuls carie: an other was of golde carried out of the ſenate houſe, &amp; the third in a triumphall chariot. Behinde them were borne the Images of his grandfathers and kinſmen dead, (except of <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> who was enrolled among the half Gods) and of all other men that euer had béen famous in <hi>Rome</hi> for their actes, beginning at <hi>Romulus:</hi> among whome was alſo an Image of <hi>Pompey</hi> the great, and al the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons whiche he had ſubdued, ſet forth in their proper ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell and habite: and after them, all his noble actes,
<pb facs="tcp:2427:72"/> conqueſtes, and victories. The hearſe being ſet downe at the <hi>Roſtra, Druſus</hi> his adopted ſonne read an Oration in writing: but at <hi>Roſtra Iulia,</hi> by the decrée of the ſenate, <hi>Tyberius</hi> had an eloquent ſpéeche vnto the people in his praiſe: whiche beeing ended, they that brought the hearſe thither, did take it vppe, and bare it out at the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphal gate.

After this the <hi>Centurions</hi> or petie capteines, taking firebrandes did ſet on fire the roge: which being abſumed, an Eagle was let to go, who flying out of the roge, did as they woulde ſay, carie <hi>Auguſtus</hi> ſoule into heauen. When all theſe thinges were done, the reſt departed: but his wife <hi>Liuia,</hi> with the chiefeſt of the horſemen tarying in that place fiue dayes, gathered together his bones, and laide them in a tumbe.

Ye haue heard before of the tumb of <hi>Porſena,</hi> and alſo of the labyrinthes, and pyramides were the tumbes of their builders.

Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this was there a ſquare roome ſet round with pillers of ſquare ſtone, euery ſide of it conteining foure acres. In it for pillers were there ſet vp beaſtes (made of one

The roofe aboue was made of ſtones two pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces broade, and garniſhed with diuers blewe ſtarres. Out of this roome was there an other entrie in, and at that a gate like vnto the firſt, but with greater ſtore of carued worke.

               <p>The other two were as her daughters, leſſe then the mother, and came vp but to her knées, one ſtanding on the right hande, the other on the left. This péece of worke was not onely worthy to be ſéene for the greate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but alſo was excellent, for the wonderfull arte and nature of the ſtones: bycauſe in ſo mightie a maſſe and pyle, there was neyther clift nor ſpot. There was written in it, I am <hi>Simandius</hi> the King of Kings, if any man would knowe what maner of man I was, and where I lye, let him excell one of my workes. They ſay, that there was alſo an other ſtatuie of the mother, of twentie cubites, made of one ſtone, hauing ouer her heade thrée Quéenes: to ſignifie, that ſhe had bene daughter, wife, and mother of a king. After this gate was there an other quadrant, more excellent then the former, with diuers ingrauings, among the which was the warres kept againſt the reuolted <hi>Bactrians,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer whome the kings ſonnes reigned: In this armie whiche he diuided into foure hoſtes, was there foure hundreth thouſande footemen, and twentie thouſande horſmen.</p>

Other, that he woulde by the likeneſſe of a Lyon, ſhewe his ſingular ſtrength of body and mynde. The ſecond wall was cut and ingrauen with priſoners without priuities and handes, led by the king: whiche was a marke that they were vile in mynde and weake in body.</p>
               <p>The thirde ſide adorned with diuers ingrauings, and gorgeous pictures, did conteine the ſacrifices of the kings and his triumph of his conquered enimies. At the middle ſide of the ſquare roome, lay two mightie ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuies made of two ſtones, eyther of them being of ſeuen and twentie cubites: at the which Images, there were thrée wayes out of the quadrant.

They being thirtie in number, were ingrauen at one part of the wall, and in the middle of them was the chiefe Iuſtice, on whoſe necke there hanged downe trueth: and the Iudge was pictured with his eyes halfe ſhut, and with a great heap of bookes lying about him. Theſe Images did ſhew that Iudges ought to be vpright, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the chiefe Iuſtice ought to looke vpon trueth only. After this there was a wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king place ful of houſes, and in them were diuers kinds of fine fiſhes, very pleaſant in taſte prepared. Then was there the king ingrauen, ſitting on highe in diuers kinds of colours, offring vnto God gold &amp; ſiluer, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mines of gold &amp; ſiluer, which he yerely receiued.

When I ſawe, ſayes <hi>Socrates,</hi> this horſe ſo generally with one conſent, praiſed of the whole citie: I ſtept vnto his kéeper, &amp; demaunded of him, what maſſe of money this ſo ſingular a horſe, and ſo highly commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded had? why ſyr quod the horſe kéeper, what money ſhould a horſe haue, he hath not one farthing? why then, ſays <hi>Socrates,</hi> if that an horſe may be an excellent horſe, and perfect in all pointes, whiche belong vnto an horſe, &amp; haue neither money, no nor goodes, nor an horſe were neuer the better horſe, if he had great riches: what then ſhold let but that a man may be a good and happie man, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out all goods? or what ſhal he be the perfecter, &amp; more bleſſed, if he haue innumerable ſtore of theſe fruites, or rather follies of fortune?

But at the length when by hanging downe of his legge, the bloud drewe vnto the wound, &amp; it wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed colde, whereby his wound began to paine him: then coulde he ſay, that he was called the Sonne of <hi>Iupiter,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:2427:98"/> but yet he felt in himſelf the paſſions of a diſeaſed bodie. But no peril that euer he ſuffered, was comparable to that whiche he ranne into through his owne deſperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, at the ſiege of the citie of the <hi>Oxidracans,</hi> as hathe <hi>Curtius,</hi> of the <hi>Mellumans,</hi> ſayes <hi>Plutarche,</hi> or as it is in <hi>Iustine,</hi> the <hi>Sicambrians.</hi> For, like a madde man he leaped downe from the walles poſt alone, into the towne: it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a thouſand to one, that he ſhould haue either béene ſlaine, or taken aliue er he coulde haue recouered his legges, the walles were ſo highe: but it happely chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, that he fel vpon his féete, and an olde tree adioyning to the wall wel defended him from being incloſed, and the boughes ſerued him for a target to keep off the darts and arrowes of many thouſands, that faſt flocked thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ende the cruell warres of the whole worlde, by one mſchiefous mans deathe: and to reuenge ſo many flouriſhing nations whiche he had ſpoiled, and ſo many frée peoples, as he had wrongfully brought into bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage. And at the length one threw a dart of two cubites long, which a litle aboue his right thighe paſſed through his corſelete: by reaſon of the whiche wounde he did ſhead ſo muche bloud, that he was not able to holde his ſworde, but let it fall out of his hande, as one at the point of death: ſo that the <hi>Indian</hi> that had ſtrucken him, came to ſpoyle him, whoſe hand when <hi>Alexander</hi> felt vpon him: diſdaine of infamie reuoked his ſpirites then paſſing out of his bodie, and with his ſworde thruſt tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough his vnarmed enimie. But yet ſo feeble was his ſtrength, that when he endeuoured to lift himſelfe vppe with the helpe of a bought of the trée: he ſtraightway fel owne againe vpon his knees.</p>
               <p>During whiche time <hi>Peuceſtes, Timaeus, Leonatus,</hi> and <hi>Ariſtonius,</hi> were come vnto him, of whome <hi>Timaeus</hi> was ſlaine, and the reſt ſo ſore wounded, that they were able to doe nothing: and they had vndoubtedly
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:2427:98"/> died there with their Prince, if that the whole armie being made almoſte madde with the rumour, that the king was ſlaine, had not at that verie inſtant violently broke into the citie, and deliuered him out of aſſured peril of death.</p>
               <p>Neither was the curing of his wounde leſſe daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, and gréeuous, then the wounde it ſelfe: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that the hookes or barbes of the darte faſtened in the fleſhe coulde not be plucked out, but by cutting of the wound wider, whereof inſued ſuche aboundance of bloud, that he fell into a ſwoone, and ſtretched out himſelfe, as one at the the panges of death: in ſo muche that all his fréendes had verily thought, that he had béen dead, ſo long was it er his bloud could be ſtaunched.</p>
               <p>Thus ye ſée howe many and oftentimes this madde man whiche would be accounted a GOD, was made painefully to féele within fewe yeares, the griefes of mannes fleſhe: the whiche was alſo, laſtly incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie increaſed by the deathe of his darling <hi>Epheſtion:</hi> whome he loued as intirely, and mourned for as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderately, as euer man did for his fréende. But when GOD ſawe that no admoniſhmentes woulde ſerue to kéepe him in his duetie, and that the Empire of the whole earthe woulde not ſatiſfie his inſatiable ambition, whiche by falling was alwayes made more hungrie, but that he woulde alſo néedes inuade hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: he did cutte his dayes ſhorter, then the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune fate of man is, not ſuffering him to paſſe the age of thirtie thrée yeares, and one moneth: and made a ſmall cophin to ſhewe, howe ſmall a thing in déede hee was: who hauing all the Orient, chafed that hée was thruſte vppe into a narrowe corner, and ſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed together. If he had followed the counſayle that the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> king gaue vnto his Father <hi>Philippe,</hi> after the fortunate battell of <hi>Choronea:</hi> and had mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
<pb facs="tcp:2427:99"/> his ſhadowe after the ouerthrowe of <hi>Darius,</hi> he ſhould haue found it neither greater, nor longer then it was before: and ſometimes he himſelfe could finde it. For whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Niceſias</hi> a flatterer, (the pernicious peſtilence of Princes) ſawe <hi>Alexander</hi> maruelouſly troubled with a medicine which he had taken, and ſaide: what paines muſt we poore wretched men abide, ſéeing that ye Gods ſuffer ſuche torments? <hi>Alexander</hi> ſternly looking on him ſaid: And what kind of Gods are we? no, I feare we be hated of the Gods. And at an other time when <hi>Anaxan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> a fortunate Philoſopher, as <hi>Atheneus</hi> termes him, one of the crowes that haunted that carrion, traueling with <hi>Alexander</hi> in a great and terrible thunder, which appauled the hartes, yea of the ſtouteſt, ſaide: haue you done the like, O mightie prince? <hi>Alexander</hi> laught, and ſaid: I wil not be ſo terrible and dreadful as thou doeſt teache me to be: who wouldeſt haue me to be ſerued at the table with the heades of kings, and princes cruelly cutte off. It is alſo reported by <hi>Plutarch,</hi> that he had béen oftentimes heard to ſay, that wheras many men called him a God: yet did he finde that hee was a man by two thinges: that is to wit, the act of Venerie, and ſléepe: for that theſe two thinges did moſt bewray the imbecillitie of his nature, but againſt all other thinges he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible.</p>
               <p>Nowe, ſléepe is an Image of death: and the act of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerie, as it were, a kinde of conuulſion. But this man who knewe him ſelfe ſo well, and beſides his often daungers of deathe, and many painefull woundes, did acknowledge that he had euer in him two things, which manifeſtly declared vnto him that he was a man, and yet woulde be adored for a GOD: yea, and when hée ſawe him ſelfe quighte paſte all hope of life, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly deſired his wyfe <hi>Satyra,</hi> priuily to conueye him away, and to caſte him into the riuer of <hi>Euphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:2427:99"/> that he might ſéeme vnto the worlde to haue bene aſſumpted body and ſoule into heauen: did not he iuſtly deſerue to be depriued of thoſe things, which the moſt vileſt varlets doe enioy? did not his wofull mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Olympias,</hi> when that ſhe heard that his body lay vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buried many dayes (the capteines of the <hi>Macedons</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing buſied about the ſucceſſion in his Empire) crye out with aboundant teares, déepe ſighes, and loud lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s?

But this huge armie was almoſt oppreſſed before it did ſet foorth.

But when he was recouered of his ſicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, he marched with thoſe that had remained in their dutiful obedience, within the ſight of his enimie, hauing ſpoyled no ſmall part of <hi>Cilicia.</hi> And then paſſing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer <hi>Amanus,</hi> he came waſting and ſpoiling vnto <hi>Cyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtes:</hi> where thinking to haue ſet vpon <hi>Seleucus,</hi> (who nowe was at his backe) in the night time: he miſſed of his purpoſe, and alſo being foiled in fight, was forced to flie backe againe amaine vnto the portes of <hi>Amanus,</hi> and there to hide himſelfe, and thoſe fewe that he had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, in the thicke wooddes, and aſſayed to goe tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the deſart and blinde wayes vnto <hi>Caunus,</hi> where he hoped to finde a fléete.

But yet here ſtaied not fortune her frowning: for <hi>Pompey</hi> gaue him ſuch a foule ouerthrow in fight, that by <hi>Caeſars</hi> own confeſſion, if he had vſed the victorie, he had that day en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the wars. And ſo great was <hi>Caeſars</hi> foile, that he was forced to prouide for his ſafetie by ſhameful diſlodging, &amp; flight. Neither was his danger leſſe, when that he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued his diſcomfited &amp; fléeing enimie the great <hi>Pompey</hi> in to Egypt: where he was ſoudenly quite contrary vnto his expectation circumuented with the whole power of

And although for bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uities ſake, I omitt his manifolde perils in thoſe wars, yet can I not paſſe ouer in ſilence: when at a conflict by ſea, betwéene his nauie &amp; the <hi>Alexandrines,</hi> he ſtanding vpon the bridge, could not by adhortation, nor threttes, ſtay the flight of his men: he leaped off from the bridge to haue lighted into one of his ſhippes: but was forced to leape ſhort through the violence of his enimies, (who ſhot all of them, thicke and thréefolde at him, being noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious for his purple mantle,) and to ſwim 200. paces vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to the next ſhip, among ſo many thouſand ſhot of his eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, &amp; alſo being clogged &amp; oppreſſed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his wet clothes &amp; he holding vp his left hand aboue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> water, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he might kéep drie certaine libels, which he held therein, &amp; alſo w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the drawing of his coate armour, after him w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his téeth, that the enimie ſhoulde not get his ſpoile. But hauing fortunately tamed the Egyptians, and alſo the king of <hi>Pontus,</hi> quieted al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Eaſt, diſcomfited y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Pompeians</hi> in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica,</hi> with <hi>Iuba</hi> king of <hi>Mauritania,</hi> and returned victor to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he triumphed foure times within one moneth at the battel of <hi>Munda</hi> in <hi>Hiſpaine</hi> againſt the two young <hi>Pompeyes,</hi> he was in ſuche an agonie of minde, that when he coulde not make his ſouldiers to go forth to fight, neither by adhortation and intreatie, nor yet by thundering threttes, he woulde haue murdered him ſelfe, and in that madde moode to die deſperately: hee gaue the charge himſelfe alone vppon the whole <hi>Pompeyan</hi> battelles, crying vnto his Souldiours: here ſhalbe the ende of my life, and of your warres. But then all his armie, either moued with their Generalles daunger, or their owne ſhame, did couragiouſly ſette forward, and vanquiſhed their enimies. They do write
<pb facs="tcp:2427:107"/> that by <hi>Caeſars</hi> only impreſſion, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Pompeyan</hi> battels gaue backe ten foote of ground, and within a ſhorte ſpace <hi>100.</hi> ſhot lighted on him: the greateſt part of whom, he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued on his target. Then ſtraight after his returne out of <hi>Hiſpaine,</hi> and thoſe godly honours giuen him at <hi>Rome,</hi> that I ſpake of before, the ſhameful and terrible diſeaſe of the falling ſickneſſe tooke him: wherby he was admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed of his fall, who fell ſo often: and of his death, who ſéemed ſo often to be dead. In this place I can not omitte that golden ſaying of <hi>Charles</hi> the fift, who when certaine of his familiars tolde him, that they came from a noble man, that was ſo extréeme ſicke, that he had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ouer the world, and thought that he muſt needs die, anſwered: what, did he not knowe that before nowe? I thank my God (quoth this good Emperour) that he hath ſent me ſtore of diſeaſes, the whiche do daily admoniſhe me of my mortalitie. But to returne vnto <hi>Caeſar,</hi> I wold be aſhamed to alledge his boldeneſſe, and the diſorderly growing of hayres, as infortunities, and inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities: if y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they had not ſo muche vexed his vaine minde, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> of al the honours that the impudent flattering <hi>Romanes</hi> hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped on him, he had reioyced ſo muche at none, as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they had granted him to weare co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually on his head, a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land of bayes, the which did couer his deformitie: &amp; alſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was ſo wayward in trimming of himſelfe, that hée wold not only be very curiouſly clipped, &amp; ſhauen, but alſo would haue diuerſe haires pulled out.

And then at pleaſure he ſolde immunities to cities, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces, he remitted Tributes, he nominated Kinges, and alies, he gaue liberties and priuileges, but to no man any thing fréely, and all theſe thinges he ſayde, he did by <hi>Caeſars</hi> Commentaries, the whiche being confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the Senate, no man had but him ſelfe. He alſo obteined to haue <hi>Macedonie</hi> allotted for his Prouince with a goodly armie, with the which he beſieged all <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina, Decius Brutus</hi> the lieftenant of <hi>Gallia Ciſalpina,</hi> the which he againſt all right and order would of ſelfe will and force haue. Wherefore he was proclamed enimie by the Senate, and the two Conſuls with <hi>Octauian. Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſars</hi> heire (whoſe authoritie was very greate with his vncles ſouldiers) were ſent againſt him: who gaue him two ouerthrowes, and forced him to rayſe his ſiege, and brought him and his armie into great miſerie. For
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:2427:108"/> when they marched on the Alpes to ioine with <hi>Lepidus:</hi> they fell into ſuch lacke of victuals, that <hi>Antonius</hi> him ſelfe did eate the barke of trées, and dranke corrupt and foule ſtinking water, and rode in miſerable and filthy habite (his heade and beard all vntrimmed, and let to growe long like vnto a wilde man) vnto <hi>Lepidus</hi> his campe, who had a great power, whome <hi>Antonius</hi> with his teares and wretched habite wonne to receiue him: when that his olde friend <hi>Lepidus</hi> had commaunded the trumpets to be blowne, that the ſouldiers ſhoulde not heare the lamentable oration of poore <hi>Antonius,</hi> leaſt he might moue them to compaſſion, as he did in very déed, with them incontinently after ioyned <hi>Plancus</hi> and <hi>Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio,</hi> with both their armies, and then alſo <hi>Octauian</hi> being feared with the great power that the murtherers of <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi> had then in <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Greece.</hi> Whereof enſued that proude and cruell Triumuirate, the which aduaunced <hi>Antonius</hi> vnto the dignitie of a God. But this brittle bliſſe of his, was craſed the next yeare with the ſiege of his brother, and deare wife at <hi>Peruſium,</hi> by <hi>Octauian,</hi> and they forced to yeald vnto him. But who can number vp the manifold daungers &amp; difficulties, that he ſuſteined, when he inuaded the <hi>Parthians</hi> with 15. legions (ſuche an armie as before that time the Romanes neuer led,) the euent whereof was nothing but diſhonour and ſhame, hauing loſt aboue 20000. footmen, and 4000. horſmen: yea, and if he had not for the ſpace of a great number of dayes vſed ſingular wiſedome, vigilancie, paines, and courage, he had neuer brought one man backe: and alſo if that a <hi>Parthian</hi> had not friendly warned him to kéepe the hard hilles, and not to come downe into the plaine countrie, they had bene ſlaine euerie mothers ſonne. One night there was ſuche an vprore in the campe, that <hi>Antonius</hi> had ſurely thought the enimie had incloſed them, and that he and all the whole armie,
<pb facs="tcp:2427:109"/> ſhould haue periſhed with the ſword of the einmie, who woulde graunt them no reſt neither day nor night. Wherefore being in vtter deſperation, he ſware one of his libertes, that he ſhould thruſt his ſworde into him when ſo euer he woulde commaunde him: and then cut off his heade, and conuey it away, that he might not be a laughing ſtock vnto his enimies, as <hi>Craſſus</hi> had bin, I doe thinke there was neuer God euer brought into ſuch an agonie. Not many yeares after this brake out that fatall warres betwéene <hi>Octauian</hi> and him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he was diſcomfited by ſea, and beſieged in <hi>Alexandria</hi> whether he fled. And to augment his ſorrowe, he ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling out of the citie with a great power took a hil, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde the fight betwéene his nauie and <hi>Octauians,</hi> ſawe his men friendly to ioyne with <hi>Octauians:</hi> &amp; immediatly the armie alſo that he him ſelfe conducted, reuolted to <hi>Octauian,</hi> and he was forced fearefully to flée into the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, being forſaken of all men. But hereof alſo grewe a greater griefe, for he thought that all was wrought through the treaſon of his dearling Quéene <hi>Cleopatra:</hi> who therefore fearing the furie of <hi>Antonius,</hi> fled into the ſepulchres of the kings, and commaunded the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culleis to be let downe, cauſing alſo one to tell <hi>Antonius,</hi> that ſhe had ſlaine her ſelfe for feare of him. With the whiche newes <hi>Antonius</hi> returning out of his rage vnto him ſelfe, cryed out: Oh <hi>Antonius,</hi> what doeſt thou now expect? ſéeing that fortune hath taken her away, who only was left a cauſe why thou ſhouldeſt deſire life. And when he had thus ſayde, he went into his chamber, where renuing his complaint, he ſayde: It grieues me not <hi>(Cleopatra)</hi> that I ſhall lacke thée, for I will be with thée incontinently: but this ſpites me, that I, that am ſo great a capteine, am ouercome in fortitude by a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: and with that called vnto his man <hi>Eros,</hi> whome he had long time before prepared for that purpoſe, and
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:2427:109"/> ſayde: come, ſyra, and with aſſured thruſt, open this breſt of myne. But <hi>Eros</hi> turning the ſword towardes his owne body, fell downe dead at his maiſters féete. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſayd <hi>Antonius, Eros</hi> alſo doth excellently well teach me what to doe: and therewithall thruſting him ſelfe through with his ſword, dyed. Whereof when <hi>Cleopatra</hi> heard, ſhe alſo ſlue her ſelfe, &amp; then <hi>Auguſtus</hi> entering the citie, murthered his two ſons <hi>Antyllus,</hi> and <hi>Caeſario:</hi> And the Senate and people of Rome decréed, that all monuments and ornaments of <hi>Antonius</hi> in all places, ſhould be caſt downe, defaced, and put out: and that the day of the moneth wherein he was borne, ſhould be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudged and accounted for an vnluckie, diſmall, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt day, wherevpon it ſhoulde not be lawfull for any iudge to ſit: and finally, that no man of the ſtocke and name of the <hi>Antonij,</hi> ſhould for euer afterwarde beare the forename of <hi>Marcus.</hi> So lowe be they brought that exalt them ſelues, and they that doe couet more honour then they deſerue, in the ende do loſe their due: and cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to be ſacred, become execrable: and verifie the old prouerbe, that pryde goeth before, and ſhame commeth after.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:2427:111"/> Goe ye your wayes ioyfull, goe your wayes riche. And then turning all his ſtudy to the care of the triumphe: beſides the priſoners of the Barbarians that fled vnto him, he choſe out alſo the talleſt men in <hi>Gallia,</hi> yea, and diuers of the Princes, and did put them by them ſelfe to ſet foorth the pompe of his trifling triumphe, and forced them not only to make red their heades (for the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes had for the moſt part red heads) and to let them grow long, but alſo to learne the Germanes language, and to be called by Barbarian names.

               <p>And before he departed out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prouince, he thought to haue ſlaine all the legions of the countrie, bycauſe that they mutining after the death of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged his father <hi>Germanicus</hi> their capteine, and him ſelfe, then being an infant.

He was alſo chaſte of bodie, that it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded of him as a miracle, in that lewde age, that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer knew woman beſides his wife. Of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which vertues he reaped moſte aboundant fruite, for he was ſingular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly liked, and loued of al men, and ſo fauoured of the peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple in all countries, that whenſoeuer he came vnto any greate towne, or departed from thence, ſuche a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of people did either goe foorthe to méete him, or to bring him going, that he was very oftentimes in daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of death, with the greate thronge of the louing peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. But when he returned out of <hi>Germanie,</hi> vnto <hi>Rome,</hi> after he had quieted the ſedition, the whiche I ſpake off euen nowe: all the <hi>Pretorian</hi> bandes wente foorth to méete him, althoughe that proclamation had béene made, that there ſhould but two goe: but of the people of <hi>Rome</hi> all ſexe, age, and order ranne foorthe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, yea twenite miles.

               <p>The day that he died, the Temples were battered with ſtones, the altars of the Gods were ouerthrowen: and ſome threwe their houſholde Gods into the ſtréete,

And alſo the <hi>Parthian,</hi> who called him ſelfe, the king of kinges, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteined from hunting, &amp; kéeping of companie: the which the <hi>Parthians</hi> call <hi>Megiſtanum,</hi> being like vnto the <hi>Iuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titium</hi> among the Romanes. But when at the firſte bruite that was brought to <hi>Rome</hi> of his ſickeneſſe, the diſmaide, and ſorrowful citie looked for the meſſengers, that followed: and ſoudenly after the euening was ſhut, it had béene noiſed without any certaine authors, that hee was recouered, the people ranne hudling from all partes of the citie, vppe into the Capitol, with lightes and ſacrifices, and they had almoſt pulled off the doores of the temple, that they ſhould not any while ſtay the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioycing people from perfourming of their vowes. <hi>Tybe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> the Emperour, was waked out of his ſléepe, with the voices of them that reioyced, and ſang in euery place: <hi>Salua Roma, Salua Patria, ſaluus eſt Germanicus, Rome</hi> is well, our Countrie is well, <hi>Germanicus</hi> is well.</p>
               <p>But afterward when it was certeinly knowen he was deade: the publique mourning coulde not be inhibited by any comfortes, nor proclamations: but laſted yea al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo all the feſtiuall dayes of December: being the ſame among them, that the twelue dayes be with vs. After that this dearling of mankinde, was traiterouſly poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned by <hi>Piſo,</hi> (who at his returne vnto <hi>Rome</hi> was ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore néere hand torne into péeces, by the people, &amp; put to death by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Senate) but at the inſtigation of his vnkinde

There was he aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and vndermined tenne thouſand ways, groped, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked, ye and in a manner forced to complaine of the wronges done vnto his Father, and his fréendes: but neuer could there be any holde taken of him, as though he had quite forgotten the fal of his fréendes, &amp; as though no ill had happened vnto any of them: but all thoſe vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies, of whom he ſuffered innumerable, he paſſed ouer with incredible diſſimulation, and was ſo ſeruiceable vnto <hi>Tyberius,</hi> and thoſe that were néere aboute him, that it was not without iuſt cauſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that neuer was there a better ſeruant, nor a worſe maiſter. In this ſlauerie continued he all the reigne of <hi>Tyberius,</hi> whom he ſuccéeded: wherby it is greatly to be maruey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, howe he, that had béene ſo long time one of the moſt wretched men of the worlde, could for ſo ſhorte a fickle felicitie, thinke him ſelf ſoudenly tranſlated into a God. But that he was alwayes guiltie in conſcience, of his owne infirmities, his ſtraunge ſpitefull enuie towards all men, that excelled in honour, good fortune, and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in any thing, did manifeſtly declare. For firſte he brake downe all the ſtatuies of famous men, that were
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:2427:113"/> ſet vppe in the Court of the Capitol by <hi>Auguſtus:</hi> he thought alſo to haue deſtroyed quite all <hi>Homers</hi> works: and there lacked litle, but that he had taken out of all li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braries, all the Images, and workes of <hi>Liuie,</hi> and <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil:</hi> and alſo he often boaſted, that he would burne al the bookes of the Lawe.

Yea, &amp; <hi>Ptolomey,</hi> king of <hi>Mauritania</hi> his coſin, whom he had ſent for, receiued, and interteined very honourably: becauſe that at a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique ſpectacle he had through the gliſtring of his purple robe cauſed the people to gaze vppon him: he ſoudenly ſtrucke him on the face, with his fiſt. As often as he mette with any beautiful perſonage, or that had a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly buſhe of haire: he would incontinently deforme him, with the ſhauing off the hinder parte of his head. There was one <hi>Eſius Proculus,</hi> whoſe Father had béene Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pile: this <hi>Proculus,</hi> for his tall, and bigge ſtature, and beautiful, and good making thereof, was called <hi>Colloſers:</hi> this mans goodly perſonage did ſo ſpite the Emperour, that ſoudenly, as <hi>Proculus</hi> was beholding of the playes: he commaunded him to fight, firſt with a <hi>Thracian,</hi> and then with an armed man, with a ſhielde, ſouldiour like: and being victor in bothe conflictes, the enuious wretch commanded him without all delay to be bound, and clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed in olde patched garments, to be carried throughout euery ſtréete of the citie, and ſhewed vnto the women, (a villanie, of all other moſte great: as thoughe he had béene a man, altogether effeminate) and then to haue his throte cutte.</p>
               <p>Finally, there was no man of ſo baſe a ſtate, nor of ſo abiect, and beggerly calling, whoſe commodities he obtrected not: in ſo muche, that when at a publique game, one <hi>Porius,</hi> a chariot man, had made his ſlaue
<pb facs="tcp:2427:114"/> frée, becauſe he had had good lucke in running, that day: and the people commending well of the maiſter for ſo doing had giuen a great ſhoute: <hi>Caligula</hi> was brought into ſuche a choler, that he incontinently flang vppe, and woulde be gone, the whiche he did with ſuche haſte, that treading vppon his gowne, he wente tumbling downe the ſteppes of the Theatre, chaſing, and crying out: that the Lord of nations, the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> did for a very light a matter, giue more honour, vnto a ſlaue chariot man, then vnto conſecrated Princes, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him ſelfe, being preſent.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, the thinneſſe of the haires of his head, and his balde crowne, bereft him of bliſſe, ſéeing that he did take it for ſuch a deformitie, that to looke out at a windowe aboue him, whereby his baldeneſſe might be eſpied, (for in <hi>Rome</hi> at thoſe dayes men went bare hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,) or vppon any occaſion to name a goate, was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent death. Yet was there a greater breach made in his bliſſe, by the death of his ſiſter, and harlot <hi>Druſilla:</hi> for it made him almoſte ſtarke madde, in ſo muche that he did let his beard, and haire growe long: and often vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſouden, and that alſo in the night time, woulde he for no cauſe fling on galloppe along all the Sea ceaſt of <hi>Italie,</hi> and ouer into <hi>Sicyl,</hi> where when he had done the like, he woulde come backe againe, as faſte vppon the ſpurre. He proclaimed for her a <hi>Iuſtitium,</hi> during the whiche time, it was deathe for a man to laughe, waſhe, or ſuppe, either with parentes, wife, or children: and yet was he alſo angrie with them that made la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation for her: becauſe as he ſaide, ſhe was of a gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, become a Goddeſſe: and to affirme this lie, he gaue vnto two men Deries ſeſtertium, that is, 7812.l. 10.s<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Who ſware, that they ſawe her aſcending vp into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. Moreouer to put him in minde of his mortalitie, he inioyed health, neither of bodie nor minde. For he was a
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:2427:114"/> childe, he was troubled with the falling ſickneſſe, &amp; after he was growen to mannes ſtate, he woulde otentimes be ſo taken, that he could neither go, ſtand, nor ſtay vpon himſelfe. And that his wittes were not wel, he himſelf perceiued, and therfore would euer and anon, thinke to ſeparate himſelfe from companie, and purge his braine. But moſt was he vexed with lacke of ſléepe, for he neuer could take aboue thrée houres reſt in a night, &amp; neither them quietly, but in great feare through diuerſe terrible dreames, and viſions. And therefore a great part of the night did he for tediouſneſſe of watching, and lying, vſe nowe ſitting in his bed, and then walking vp and down in long galleries, euer and anon to call, &amp; looke for daye. Once in his ſhort reigne was he very dangerouſly ſicke, in ſo muche, that of a fooliſhe flatterie <hi>Publius Africanus Potitius</hi> ſware, that if that the Gods woulde vouchſafe of their woonted goodneſſe to graunt life vnto <hi>Caligula,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> then he would gladly léeſe his life for him: and <hi>Secundus,</hi> a horſeman of <hi>Rome,</hi> vpon the ſame condition, vowed to fight at a game of ſword players: bothe whiche vowes did <hi>Caligula,</hi> when he was recouered make them to fulfil leaſt they ſhuld be forſworne: worthily, though ingrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, forcing them to die, who would wickedly, though feignedly, wiſh his life, that did daily take away life fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo many good men. But <hi>Suetonius</hi> writes, that he made the horſeman to fight in his ſight, and would not let him go before he had vanquiſhed: no nor then neither, but after great interceſſion: but the other madde man, who made no great haſte to perfourme that whiche he had raſhely ſworne: he cauſed to be whipped, and clothed in a ſacrificeng robe: and then deliuered him vnto Boyes, who ſtill requeſting of him, as they went, the perfourmaunce of his vowe, ſhoulde driue him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longe throughout all the Stréetes, vntil that at the

               <p>Moreouer, this Godleſſe man, that contemned all GODS, and as I haue before alledged out of <hi>Dion,</hi> woulde thunder againſte thunder: doeth <hi>Suetonius</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, would oftentimes be ſo afraide of a ſmall thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and lightening, that he would winke, and blinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folde him ſelfe: but if it were great, créepe out of his bedde, and hide him vnder it. And alſo he was ſo fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in <hi>Sicyl,</hi> with the ſmoke, and noiſe of the hil <hi>Aetna,</hi> that ſoudenly in the night he fledde out of the citie of <hi>Meſſana.</hi> And alſo hearing that <hi>Germanie</hi> had rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, he prepared to runne away from <hi>Rome,</hi> and rigged ſhippes in a readineſſe, to carrie him thence, reſting in this one only comfort, that he ſhoulde haue left vnto him the Prouinces beyond the Sea, if that the <hi>Germanes</hi> did take the toppes of the <hi>Alpes:</hi> as in olde time the <hi>Cym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bri</hi> had done, or elſe the citie, as had the <hi>Seuones.</hi> He liued onely twentie nine yeares, whereof he reigned but thrée yeares, and tenne monethes, and eight dayes, and thoſe, in howe great feare, and hofulneſſe, his conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual putting of men to death, for treaſon againſt him, and his curious ſearching, for Oracles, and propheſies, do declare: all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which yet could not ſaue him, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being ſlaine with his wife, and his daughter, whoſe braines were daſhed out, againſt the wall.

But he might in déede haue truely triumphed of flies, of whome he doubtleſſe flue innumerable. For at the beginning of his reigne, he vſed to haue euerie daye a ſecrete houre to catch flies, and to thruſt them through with a long péece of yron made for the nonce: ſo that it
<pb facs="tcp:2427:116"/> was as merrily, as wittily anſwered of <hi>

He alſo deſerued a iuſt triumph ouer wilde beaſts, of whom he would kil vpon the Theatre an hundreth in a day with his bowe, beſtowing his arrowes ſo artificially, that they ſéemed to be hornes growing out of their heads. For he was ſo good an archer, that he would oftentimes cauſe a boy to ſtand a great diſtance off, &amp; hold vp his hand abroad, and he would ſhoote betwéene euery finger, and neuer hurt them. But ſéeing that not great conqueſtes, but only riches left vnto him, did make him to conceiue ſo highly of him ſelfe: my thinkes he might well haue ben put in minde of his mortalitie, by calling to memorie his youth paſſed in greate pouertie and infamie, as he that had not one péece of plate, and did ſhamefully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute his body: ſo that there were at Rome that did of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſhewe, after he came to the Empire, his hande and ſeale for a nights lodging.

What torments may we thinke tore him, when he vnderſtoode the adulterie of his deare wife <hi>Domitia,</hi> (by whom he had a ſonne, and had proclamed her <hi>Auguſta,</hi> or Empreſſe) with <hi>Paris</hi> a
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:2427:116"/> common player, whome ſhe loued as openly, as ſhe did feruently. Whervpon he did put her away, but within ſhort time after, being impatient of the diuorce, tooke her againe, ſéeking to colour his ignominie in ſo doing with a feigned tale, that the people had deſired him to do it. I do omit what griefe his bald head brought him, who would draw vnto his own reproch, if that the like were obiected vnto any other man, eyther in earneſt or ſport: and alſo his often infirmities, through whome he became deformouſly ſpindle ſhanked.

This ſiege helde him an whole yeare and more. Before <hi>Parma</hi> in the place where he incamped, had he laide out a plotte to builde a newe citie on, and appointed places for churches: and the highe, and chiefe churche he dedicated vnto Saint <hi>Victor,</hi> for a good abodement of happie ſucceſſe: and the other, bothe publike and priuate buildings beganne to goe vp ſumptuouſly.

With the whiche two aduerſe battels, he that had thought in his hart to haue appointed Lawes vnto all chriſtendome, being broken: was glad to gette peace by reſtoring all that he had of the kinges of <hi>Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paine,</hi> the Quéenes of England, (or elſe to pay well for it,) of the Dukes of <hi>Sauoy, Florence,</hi> and <hi>Mantua,</hi> the Biſhoppe of <hi>Leige,</hi> and the <hi>Genowaies,</hi> and to withdrawe his gariſons out of the territorie of <hi>Siena:</hi> and at the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphe kept for the eſpouſals of his daughter, whom he had giuen in marriage vnto the king of <hi>Hiſpaine,</hi> as it were for a pledge of the peace, he was ſlain at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Tilt by the Count <hi>Montgomerie,</hi> in the laſt courſe that he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to haue runne.

                  <hi>Octauian</hi> being thus beſett on all ſides with trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, coueted to pleaſe bothe the Senate and people, and alſo the ſouldiours: but in verie déede he offended them both: in ſo muche that he had béene almoſt ſlaine by the ſouldiours, for commaunding at a playe a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſouldiour to be taken vpp, that ſate vppon one of the xiiii. greeces, where, by the law, no man might ſitt vnder the degrée of an horſeman of <hi>Rome.</hi> Hereunto addeth <hi>Plinie,</hi> the famine that was in <hi>Italie</hi> by reaſon that <hi>Sextus Pompeyus</hi> and <hi>Domitius</hi> woulde ſuffer no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be brought thether by Sea.</p>

               <p>Twice alſo was he greately endaungered by tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt, all the tacklinges of the ſhipp, wherein he was, béeing broken all into péeces, and the rudder cleane ſtrucken off.</p>

Some other ſickneſſes had he that did take him euery yeare, and would returne alwayes at a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine time.

               <p>But beſide theſe manifolde miſchiefes, there happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned alſo many earthquakes, to put him in mynde of his maker: twice was <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> ſore ſhaken, but the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time did farre paſſe all that euer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> citie before had felt, both for the ſtrange time of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> yeare, being in Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the long continuance, being diuers dayes the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing of a great number of houſes and edifices, and loſing the ioyntes of moe: and the ſlaying of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite people, among whome was the Lorde ſtewarde of

This earthquake did alſo take &amp; deſtroy <hi>Berytus,</hi> a beautiful citie of <hi>Phoenicia,</hi> the whole Iſle of <hi>Cos,</hi> and ſundry cities of <hi>Aeolis</hi> &amp; <hi>Ionia.</hi>

Then alſo chaunced there as ſtraunge a peſtilence, the which as it did paſſe all that are committed to memorie, for the long continuance thereof, being fiftie yeares, ſo may it well match with the woorſt, for large dominion and mortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which by <hi>Nycephorus</hi> his report, raged through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all parts of the Romane Empire, and left few men of that age vntouched. This plague againſt the which (as writeth <hi>Procopius</hi>) who liued in that time (ther could neuer remedie be found) began in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and crept ſtil forward into al countries, leauing, no, not any obſcure place vntouched, nor neuer taking one perſon twice. The manner of the diſeaſe was this.</p>
               <p>As many as were taken therewithall, did thinke that ſome man had giuen them a blow, whervpon they fell ſicke incontinently on a ſouden. This ſtraunge kynde of taking, made many at the firſt to ſéeke, but in

               <p>Some againe would doe nothing but ſléepe ſoundly, but moe were wilde madde, and would often crye out, that ſome haled and aſſaulted them: wherewithall they would runne backward, breaking their neckes downe the ſtaires, and other did runne into riuers, to quenche their thirſt. Some dyed the firſt daye, but moſt many dayes after. Thrée monethes did this plague continue at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> at the firſt killing but fewe, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde fiue thouſande on a day, and alſo more often ten thouſand: in ſo much, that a great number of rich men, hauing loſt all their ſeruants by this diſeaſe, dyed alſo them ſelues, rather through lacke of kéeping, then by ſickneſſe, and then alſo remained vnburied. Yet was not this diſeaſe contagious, that one man did take it of an other, and alſo this good qualitie it had, that it would take no man twice. And now in the afflicted citie were ſéene no Arts exerciſed, no ſhoppes open, and moſt for feare, leauing their former life, did put on newe man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and wholy dedicated them ſelues vnto religion and godlineſſe.</p>
               <p>And alſo after a certaine courſe of yeares, the ſame plague (which had neuer cleane ceaſed) beganne againe rufully to rage: conſuming almoſt al thoſe that the firſt had ſpared, and nowe very many woulde fall downe
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:2427:148"/> ſtarke dead very ſoudenly at the firſt taking, and farre moe men died then women. And yet a greater miſhap chaunced vnto this vnhappie Emperour: whiche was, that he had ſo proude, ſo couetous, ſo cruel, ſo vngodly a woman to his wife: who made him, who ruled the whole worlde, to be her vile ſlaue at becke to committe all outrages: firſt to baniſh from their Sées, two god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Biſhoppes of <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe they would not wickedly conſent vnto the vniuſt reſtitution of the Heretique <hi>Anthemius,</hi> one depriued for his impietie of the Sea of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> by a generall counſell helde in that Citie in the preſence of the Emperour himſelfe: the firſte of them <hi>(Syluerius)</hi> was ſhorne, and thruſt into a Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, but the latter <hi>(Vigilius)</hi> was whipped almoſte to death: and afterward hauing eſcaped their cruel hands, was drawen out of the church by a rope faſtened about his necke along all the citie of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a paineful priſon, there to be pined away with water and breade, giuen him in ſmall quantitie: and then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward to ſatiſfie her ſtately ſtomach againſt <hi>Beliſamis</hi> his proude wife, he againſt all right and honour, berefte him of his ſight, who was the light of his Martial glorie.</p>
               <p>But here ſtayed not his infortunitie, for in his latter dayes he him ſelfe falling into that hereſie, that Chriſte did take vpon him an impaſſible bodie: and being wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully bent to haue all men follow his wicked follie, moſt cruelly perſecuted the Catholiques, baniſhing among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Entichius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and was buſied about the drawing of a precepte for the banniſhment of <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Antioche,</hi> or as then they called it, after the reedification by <hi>Iuſtinian, Theopolis,</hi> a man of al the Biſhoppes of the Eaſt farre moſte famous for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found learning in diuinity and alſo for integritie of life, becauſe that he woulde not ſubſcribe vnto his vngodly geare: but he could not finiſh his wicked worke, being

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of many dolefull diſeaſes.

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:2427:162"/> is yron, and <hi>Aſſacke</hi> halting.

               <p>This ſorrowfull meſſage did put <hi>Tamerlane</hi> in greate feare, leaſt that the kinge of <hi>India</hi> woulde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne againe, and ſweepe him out of all his domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons at hoame, while hee was buſied abroade with forreigne warres: and herewithall the curſed conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on alſo of humaine affaires, and mannes tickle ſtate, the which doeth not ſuffer any man long to enioye here on earth the bliſful blaſt of friendly Fortune, appalled his hearte: wherefore hee haſted homewarde: and whereas before hee iniuried al men, nowe did hee not onely put vpp cowardly the <hi>Indian</hi> wrong, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo made greate ſute to recouer his auncient friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe.</p>

               <p>Hee conſultinge with the Southſayers, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrologians, about theſe wounders, was tolde by them, and namely, by one <hi>Bene-iaacam,</hi> a man of greateſt authoritie and credite amonge them, that they were tokens, either of his owne death ſhortlye after to enſue, or elſe of the vtter ruine and brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginge to naught of his Empire.</p>
               <p>But muche more was he in ſhort time after ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by a viſion that hee had one night, the whiche was the cauſe of his fatall ſickeneſſe, and in the ende, of his death.</p>
               <p>For hee dreamed one night, that <hi>Baiazeth</hi> the Turke whome hee had made to die miſerably in an y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron cage, came vnto him, or elſe the diuell in his like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, with a countenaunce ſterne, and terrible to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde, and ſaide vnto him: nowe it ſhall not be long (villaine) but that thou ſhalt worthilye bee payde for thy manifolde outrages: and I too ſhall be reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, for the weriſome wrong that thou diddeſt vnto mee, making mee to die like vnto a beaſt in mine own doung.</p>
